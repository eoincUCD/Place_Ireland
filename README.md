My Reddit R/Place Event Contribution

Unfortunately I made a mess of creating the original repository which led to links to a previous project I had worked on with team members in college. This new repository should remove those false links.

My contribution was copying another reddit users script and updating it to match a new design for the canvas.



Reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/62sfy2/rplace_mega_thread/

Script to automatically generate an Irish flag in the r/place project.

1) Open up www.reddit.com/r/place in a new firefox or chrome tab.
2) Press F12 (or "Tools > Developer Tools" on mac)
3) Select the 'console' tab
4) Copy and paste the following into the box:
$.getScript("https://rawgit.com/eoincUCD/Place_Ireland/master/Fleg_Harp.js");
5) Press Enter
6) Leave tab open forever.
